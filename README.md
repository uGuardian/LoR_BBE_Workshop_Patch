# BBE_Workshop_Patch
## This patch is now obsolete, no longer needed, and in fact actively breaks BBE.
~~This is a BepInEx plugin that can be placed alongside BBE to fix the compatibility issues of the two.
It's placed in the Library Of Ruina\BepInEx\plugins folder.~~

~~This does not guarantee 100% compatibility, this just fixes the issue where no workshop DLLs are loaded when BBE is installed.~~

~~If you're compiling this, you need to reference BongBongEnterprises.dll and BepInEx core dlls.~~
