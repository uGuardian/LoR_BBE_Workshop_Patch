# BBE_Workshop_Patch
This is a BepInEx plugin that can be placed alongside BBE to fix the compatibility issues of the two.
It's placed in the Library Of Ruina\BepInEx\plugins folder.

This does not guarantee 100% compatibility, this just fixes the issue where no workshop DLLs are loaded when BBE is installed.
